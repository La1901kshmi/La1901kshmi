# **A vercel or any other public hosted link (IMP)**
* We should install map in react (npm install --react-simple-maps) => https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-maps

# **A paragraph explaining that help you to create project (IMP)**

 * The javascript engine finds the index.html file initially and then redirects it to the index.js file which again finds the App.js/App.jsx file where all the related logic related to all the components are written here(Also the components are imported here)

 * The App.js file has the routing component structure of the main Nav-Bar from where we can route to any components on the click 
 
 * The WorldMap.js file contains react-simple-map library and the required place along with the co-ordinates are fetched and displayed on the browser. We can add the required co-ordinates . I have fetcehd the required co-ordinates using the link: => https://www.latlong.net/

 * The Line chart which gives the information about the purchase, sales & Earning
 that I take from APEX-CHART 1st WE have to install that library i.e - npm install react-apexcharts apexchart. 
 and the take graph from => https://apexcharts.com/docs/chart-types/line-chart/
  
* Also install npm install --react-simple-maps => https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-maps

* For routing we have to install react router dom => https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom

* Google fonts => https://fonts.google.com/
 

* Also install react-bootstrap for using fonts and style => https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/getting-started/introduction/ -->
